# Go with Vue

This project is a modern adaptation of the Udemy course ["Working with Vue 3 and Go"](https://www.udemy.com/course/working-with-vue-3-and-go/), rebuilt using Nuxt 4, TypeScript, and the Nuxt UI library (with Tailwind CSS). The backend will use Go, with updates and improvements planned.

Currently experimenting with Windsurf IDE for development.
