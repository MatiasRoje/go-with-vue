# Go with Vue (Nuxt 4 Edition)

This project is a modern adaptation of the Udemy course "Working with Vue 3 and Go", rebuilt using Nuxt 4, TypeScript, and the Nuxt UI library (with Tailwind CSS). The backend will use Go, with updates and improvements planned.

Currently experimenting with Windsurf IDE for development.
