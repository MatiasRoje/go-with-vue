# Go with Vue

This project is a modern adaptation of the Udemy course ["Working with Vue 3 and Go"](https://www.udemy.com/course/working-with-vue-3-and-go/), rebuilt using Nuxt 4, TypeScript, and the Nuxt UI library (with Tailwind CSS). The backend will use Go, with some updates and improvements.

A few sections were dismissed as not considered very interesting or useful, as doing CRUD operations with database objects as books or users directly from the UI. Otherwise the whole section about testing in Go was also dismissed as this might be explored in some other projects.

Currently experimenting with Windsurf IDE for development.
